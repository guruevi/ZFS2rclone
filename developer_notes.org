* Notes

Current status  of this script  is ... experimental. It will remain so until we have a good backup and restore  that puts  in place a few things :
** play nice with zfs-auto-snapshot
** allow for restoring a chain of snapshots that is complete
** can survive a suspend and resume


* Tasks

** TODO allow script to backup and resume properly for suspend
** TODO allow script  to resume when cancelled
